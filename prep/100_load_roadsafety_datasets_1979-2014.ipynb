    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will begin our analysis of UK Road Safety Data 1979 - 2014. Primarily, we will focus on loading and reviewing our datasets. These datasets are split up into four Vehicle and Accident Datasets for all Recorded UK Road Accidents from  1979 - 2004, and 2005 - 2014. We will then save these datasets into files.\n",
